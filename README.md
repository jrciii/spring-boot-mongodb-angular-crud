# spring-boot-mongodb-angular-crud
Basic CRUD with Spring Boot, MongoDB, and Angular

TODO: Finish frontend :)
So far, only the backend is implemented with a RestController, a MongoRepository and an Employee domain entity.
As for the testing, there is only one integration test which uses Spring's MockMvc and embedded MongoDB libraries.
